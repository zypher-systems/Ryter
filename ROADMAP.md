# Roadmap

Living plan for Ryter. Orchestrator and specialists update this as work lands.

## Now

- 0.2.0 TUI redesign (`design.md`) — all seven phases landed on `0.2.0-patch`; PR to `dev` for outside review, then `dev` → `main`
- Resolve `design.md` open items in review: O-01 drop `Spend` as the `busy` fallback once headless/MCP consumers read `TurnFinished`; O-02 `ryter doctor --json` (CLI, not the panel); O-03 `light` theme shipped but marked experimental; O-04 per-message copy deferred with the clipboard question

## Next

- 0.2.1 — follow-ups from the redesign review: light-theme contrast pass on real terminals, kitty keyboard protocol for Shift+Enter where the terminal supports it, `/theme` custom `~/.ryter/themes/*.toml` preview of the full syntax palette
- 0.3.0 — Landlock default-on once it is boring
- 0.3.0 — headless `ryter -p` output that reuses the TUI markdown renderer for `--pretty`

## Later

- macOS / Windows
- SQLite FTS over notes when DECISIONS.md outgrows a prompt
- Session search across transcripts from `/sessions`

## Done

### 0.2.0 — TUI redesign (2026-09-20)

- Phase 1 Foundation: `Message` model, unicode-aware wrapping, LRU render cache, `ChatScroll` with stick-to-bottom + auto-release, sticky turn header, scrollbar
- Phase 2 Reading: speaker headers (`[ui] username` → git → `$USER` → `you`), markdown block+inline renderer, syntect + two-face highlighting on Ryter’s palette, extended theme with light/dark/16-color/`NO_COLOR` degradation
- Phase 3 Writing: multiline composer with bracketed paste, prompt history, secret mode, single `KEYMAP` table, context-aware hint bar
- Phase 4 Awareness: activity strip (collapsed ticker / `Ctrl+R` pane), `TurnStarted`/`TurnFinished` core events with duration and breakdown, card-based info panel with drop order
- Phase 5 Command surface: `CommandSpec` registry, fuzzy command palette with categories and keybinding column, `PanelStack` framework, shared chrome, form widget kit
- Phase 6 Panels: every slash command is a bordered panel (`/settings` `/provider` `/models` `/crew` `/mcp` `/skills` `/hooks` `/sessions` `/agents` `/spend` `/theme` `/tools` `/auditor` `/phase`), new `/context` `/help` `/doctor`; permission / ask / trust are modal interrupts; inline ask bar removed
- Phase 7 Polish: `[ui]` config section, golden snapshot suite at 80×24 / 100×30 / 120×40 / 160×50, redraw budget test, `RYTER.md` chrome rule replaced, decisions recorded

### 0.1.x

- Rust workspace, BYOK SpaceXAI + OpenRouter, spend `$?.??`
- Session, agent loop, TUI, worktrees + auditor auto-merge
- MCP inbound/outbound, skills, hooks, themes
- Compact, doctor, Landlock opt-in
- Last-used provider/model, catalog price/window on load
- Project memory: ROADMAP + DECISIONS + notes
- Planner and architect spawn from the queue; tagged specialist chat; short handback
- Per-role `[specialists.*]` routing; queue batches run in parallel up to `max`
- `/crew` assigns models per role; factory default follows the orchestrator
- Real cancel (Esc / `/cancel` / `ryter_cancel`) kills bash process groups
- `ryter serve --socket` / `--bind` + token; TUI attaches on `~/.ryter/ryter.sock`
- Session `/resume` `/rename` `/delete`; `ryter sessions` / `ryter resume`
- `/agents` roster; Enter kills one specialist
- `/mcp` floating inbound/outbound menu, bearer tokens, client links
- `/skills` and `/hooks` floating menus (list, add stub / add hook, remove)
- TUI permission Ask (`y`/`n`/`a`) and `ask_user`
- `/spend` table overlay; `/settings` (budget, warn, max, sandbox, inbound, web)
- `ryter connections` list/add/remove/test; `ryter models`
- First-run writes `~/.ryter/config.toml`; TUI “trust this project?”
- Extra builder turn on merge conflict; `~/.ryter/logs/ryter.log`
- `[features] web` + `web_fetch` / `web_search` (SSRF-blocked)
