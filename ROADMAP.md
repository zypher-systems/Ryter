# Roadmap

Living plan for Ryter. Orchestrator and specialists update this as work lands.

## Now

- 0.2.0 TUI redesign (`design.md`) — all seven phases landed on `0.2.0-patch`; PR to `dev` for outside review, then `dev` → `main`
- `gaps.md` review closed: G-01..G-07 all fixed. One new item opened there — S-01, the snapshot harness cannot see style, so `R-POP-04` (dim behind a panel) is unassertable
- Resolve `design.md` open items in review: O-01 drop `Spend` as the `busy` fallback once headless/MCP consumers read `TurnFinished`; O-02 `ryter doctor --json` (CLI, not the panel); O-03 `light` theme shipped but marked experimental; O-04 per-message copy deferred with the clipboard question (mitigated: `Ctrl+G` releases the mouse so terminal selection works)

## Next

Correctness and cost follow-ups from the 0.2.0 review (see `DECISIONS.md` 2026-09-21):

- **`/diff` review surface.** The auto-merge gate is an LLM auditor that by default is the same model as the builder, so PASS is not an independent opinion. Merging now refuses a dirty tree and records an undo sha, but the real fix is letting the user see a builder's diff before it lands.
- **Streamed `bash` output.** The shell buffers, so a 120s build shows nothing until it finishes. Needs an incremental `AgentEvent`.
- **Reconcile the context gauge with real usage.** `estimate_tokens` is bytes/4 and is never checked against the provider's `input_tokens`, which is already parsed into `Usage`. Auto-compact at 85% therefore fires on a guess, and there is no retry-with-compaction when a provider rejects a turn for length.
- **Budget cap with unpriced models.** `over_budget` cannot trip when spend is unknown, so an unpriced model has no cap. The UI no longer claims otherwise (`?%`), but the guardrail is absent — needs either a token-based cap or a refusal to run unpriced without an explicit opt-in.
- **Compaction keeps a summary, not just a file list.** `extract_prefix` preserves tool names, touched paths, and the pass note; all prose is dropped. Deliberate (deterministic, no extra model call) but lossy enough to feel like amnesia in a long session.
- **`ryter-cli` has no tests.** 934 lines, one integration test. `--prompt`, `serve`, `sessions`, exit code 3 for budget — all unverified. Also missing for automation: `--allowed-tools`, `--max-turns`, headless `--resume`, shell completions.
- **Anthropic extended thinking + tools.** "Reasoning is display-only" is right for most providers, but thinking blocks must be echoed back on the `messages` backend or the API rejects the request. `Message.content: String` structurally forbids it (as it does images).
- **Transcript anchoring.** A short transcript is top-anchored, so an idle 160×50 is mostly blank above the composer. Whether it should sit above the composer like a terminal chat is a `design.md` question (see `gaps.md` G-03).
- **Confirm grok-4.6's context window.** `compact::window_for` says 500k; the TUI fixtures say 256k. The catalog value wins at runtime, so this only matters pre-connection, but the two should agree.

Previously listed:

- 0.2.1 — light-theme contrast pass on real terminals, kitty keyboard protocol for Shift+Enter where the terminal supports it, `/theme` custom `~/.ryter/themes/*.toml` preview of the full syntax palette
- 0.3.0 — Landlock default-on once it is boring; consider ABI V4 for `AccessNet` (the sandbox is filesystem-only today)
- 0.3.0 — headless `ryter -p` output that reuses the TUI markdown renderer for `--pretty`

## Later

- macOS / Windows
- SQLite FTS over notes when DECISIONS.md outgrows a prompt
- Session search across transcripts from `/sessions`

## Done

### 0.2.0-patch — review fixes (2026-09-21)

- Tool calling on the Responses and Messages backends: `tool_calls` / `tool_call_id` were dropped on the request side, so every agentic turn past the first shipped an empty assistant message and an invalid `role: "tool"`. Broken out of the box, since the default connection is spacexai/responses. Per-backend body tests added.
- Permission gate rewritten to judge shell commands per segment; 13 table-driven tests where there were none.
- Safety coherence: `Enter` no longer allows on the permission modal, the auditor no longer bypasses the gate, auto-merge refuses a dirty checkout and lands `--no-ff` with a recorded undo sha.
- Provider reliability: retry with backoff and `Retry-After` on transient failures; idle-read timeout instead of a total request deadline.
- Cost control: every tool result capped at 32k keeping both ends, `read_file` pages with `offset`/`limit`, prompt caching on the Messages backend, truncation surfaced as `StopReason::Truncated`.
- Shell usable for real builds: `-c` instead of `-lc`, 120s default with a per-call `timeout_secs`.
- Secrets: a key lives in one store (keyring xor 0600 file, reported to the user), the SSRF guard resolves DNS and unwraps IPv4-mapped IPv6, the Landlock writable set no longer includes `keys/`.
- TUI: panels own the body (G-01/G-02/G-06), unknown spend renders `?%` not `$0.00` (G-04), empty cards absent (G-03), hint bar keeps cancel/quit (G-05), session card leads with title+phase (G-07), `Ctrl+G` releases the mouse for text selection.

### 0.2.0 — TUI redesign (2026-09-20)

- Phase 1 Foundation: `Message` model, unicode-aware wrapping, LRU render cache, `ChatScroll` with stick-to-bottom + auto-release, sticky turn header, scrollbar
- Phase 2 Reading: speaker headers (`[ui] username` → git → `$USER` → `you`), markdown block+inline renderer, syntect + two-face highlighting on Ryter’s palette, extended theme with light/dark/16-color/`NO_COLOR` degradation
- Phase 3 Writing: multiline composer with bracketed paste, prompt history, secret mode, single `KEYMAP` table, context-aware hint bar
- Phase 4 Awareness: activity strip (collapsed ticker / `Ctrl+R` pane), `TurnStarted`/`TurnFinished` core events with duration and breakdown, card-based info panel with drop order
- Phase 5 Command surface: `CommandSpec` registry, fuzzy command palette with categories and keybinding column, `PanelStack` framework, shared chrome, form widget kit
- Phase 6 Panels: every slash command is a bordered panel (`/settings` `/provider` `/models` `/crew` `/mcp` `/skills` `/hooks` `/sessions` `/agents` `/spend` `/theme` `/tools` `/auditor` `/phase`), new `/context` `/help` `/doctor`; permission / ask / trust are modal interrupts; inline ask bar removed
- Phase 7 Polish: `[ui]` config section, golden snapshot suite at 80×24 / 100×30 / 120×40 / 160×50, redraw budget test, `RYTER.md` chrome rule replaced, decisions recorded

### 0.1.x

- Rust workspace, BYOK SpaceXAI + OpenRouter, spend `$?.??`
- Session, agent loop, TUI, worktrees + auditor auto-merge
- MCP inbound/outbound, skills, hooks, themes
- Compact, doctor, Landlock opt-in
- Last-used provider/model, catalog price/window on load
- Project memory: ROADMAP + DECISIONS + notes
- Planner and architect spawn from the queue; tagged specialist chat; short handback
- Per-role `[specialists.*]` routing; queue batches run in parallel up to `max`
- `/crew` assigns models per role; factory default follows the orchestrator
- Real cancel (Esc / `/cancel` / `ryter_cancel`) kills bash process groups
- `ryter serve --socket` / `--bind` + token; TUI attaches on `~/.ryter/ryter.sock`
- Session `/resume` `/rename` `/delete`; `ryter sessions` / `ryter resume`
- `/agents` roster; Enter kills one specialist
- `/mcp` floating inbound/outbound menu, bearer tokens, client links
- `/skills` and `/hooks` floating menus (list, add stub / add hook, remove)
- TUI permission Ask (`y`/`n`/`a`) and `ask_user`
- `/spend` table overlay; `/settings` (budget, warn, max, sandbox, inbound, web)
- `ryter connections` list/add/remove/test; `ryter models`
- First-run writes `~/.ryter/config.toml`; TUI “trust this project?”
- Extra builder turn on merge conflict; `~/.ryter/logs/ryter.log`
- `[features] web` + `web_fetch` / `web_search` (SSRF-blocked)
